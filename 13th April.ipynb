    "**Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning algorithm that belongs to the family of Random Forests. It is used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous outcome. The Random Forest Regressor builds multiple decision trees during training and outputs the average prediction of the individual trees for a given input during inference. This ensemble approach tends to improve the model's accuracy and robustness compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through two key mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bootstrap Sampling:** Each tree in the Random Forest is trained on a random subset of the training data, sampled with replacement (bootstrap sampling). This introduces diversity in the training sets for individual trees, preventing them from fitting the noise in the data too closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Randomization:** At each split in a decision tree, only a random subset of features is considered for the split. This additional randomization further decorrelates the trees, making them less prone to overfitting specific features.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining predictions from multiple trees, the ensemble tends to be more robust and less likely to overfit to peculiarities in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor aggregates predictions from multiple decision trees by averaging the individual tree predictions. For each input sample, each decision tree in the ensemble produces a prediction. The final prediction of the Random Forest Regressor is the average of these individual tree predictions. This aggregation process helps to smooth out noise and capture the underlying trend in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What are the hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important hyperparameters of the Random Forest Regressor include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **n_estimators:** The number of decision trees in the forest.\n",
    "- **max_depth:** The maximum depth of each decision tree.\n",
    "- **min_samples_split:** The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.\n",
    "- **min_samples_leaf:** The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\n",
    "- **max_features:** The maximum number of features considered for a split.\n",
    "- **bootstrap:** Whether to use bootstrap sampling during the construction of trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "These hyperparameters allow you to control the complexity, size, and behavior of the Random Forest Regressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. What is the difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensemble vs. Single Tree:** Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble of multiple decision trees, whereas Decision Tree Regressor is a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overfitting Control:** Random Forest Regressor mitigates overfitting by aggregating predictions from multiple trees, using bootstrap sampling and feature randomization. Decision Tree Regressor, when not pruned appropriately, may overfit the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robustness:** Random Forest Regressor tends to be more robust and generalizable compared to a single Decision Tree Regressor, especially in the presence of noisy or complex data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Reduced Overfitting:** Random Forest Regressor reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "- **Robustness:** It is robust to noise and outliers in the data.\n",
    "- **Good Performance:** Random Forests often achieve good performance with minimal hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "- **Feature Importance:** The algorithm provides a measure of feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- **Less Interpretability:** The ensemble of trees makes it less interpretable compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "- **Computational Complexity:** Training and prediction times can be higher than those for simpler models.\n",
    "- **Parameter Tuning:** While it's less sensitive to hyperparameters, tuning may still be necessary for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. What is the output of Random Forest Regressor?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of a Random Forest Regressor is a continuous prediction for each input sample. For regression tasks, the algorithm predicts a numerical value for each input, representing the estimated target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8. Can Random Forest Regressor be used for classification tasks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "While Random Forest Regressor is designed for regression tasks (predicting continuous variables), Random Forests can also be used for classification tasks. In classification, the ensemble is referred to as a Random Forest Classifier, and it outputs class probabilities or class labels based on the majority vote of the individual decision trees. The term \"Random Forest\" is often used to encompass both Random Forest Regressor and Random Forest Classifier, depending on the nature of the target variable."
