    "# Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would use each type of test.\n",
    "\n",
    "A t-test and a z-test are both statistical hypothesis tests used to determine if there is a significant difference between two groups or conditions. However, they differ in their assumptions and when they are applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. T-test:\n",
    "The t-test is used when the sample size is small (typically less than 30) and when the population standard deviation is unknown. It is more appropriate when dealing with smaller sample sizes because it accounts for the uncertainty introduced by using the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenario for using a t-test:\n",
    "Let's say you want to compare the average scores of two groups of students who have undergone different teaching methods. Group A consists of 15 students, and Group B has 20 students. You want to determine if there is a significant difference in their mean scores on a particular test. In this case, you would use a t-test because the sample sizes are relatively small (less than 30).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Z-test:\n",
    "The z-test, on the other hand, is used when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30) or when the population standard deviation is known. It assumes that the sample mean is normally distributed and relies on the known population standard deviation for making inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenario for using a z-test:\n",
    "Let's say you want to compare the heights of two different populations: the heights of adult males in City A and City B. City A has a large population, and you collected height data from a random sample of 200 individuals. City B's population is also large, and you gathered data from 250 individuals. If the population standard deviation of height in both cities is known, you can use a z-test to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean heights between the two cities.\n",

    "# Q2: Differentiate between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.\n",
    "One-tailed and two-tailed tests are types of hypothesis tests used in statistical analysis. They differ in how they assess the significance of a relationship or difference between groups or conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One-tailed test:\n",
    "A one-tailed test, also known as a directional test, is used to determine if the value of a parameter is significantly greater than or less than a specific value or a hypothesized value. In other words, it tests for a specific direction of effect. The critical region for the test is only on one side of the distribution curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's say a researcher wants to test the hypothesis that a new teaching method will improve test scores and expects that the new method will lead to higher scores. The one-tailed test would be appropriate in this case, as the researcher is only interested in whether the new method's effect is greater than the existing method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Two-tailed test:\n",
    "A two-tailed test, also known as a non-directional test, is used to determine if there is a significant difference between two groups or conditions, without specifying the direction of the effect. The critical region for the test is on both sides of the distribution curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose a researcher wants to test if there is a significant difference in test scores between two groups using different teaching methods, but they don't have a specific hypothesis about which method will perform better. In this scenario, a two-tailed test would be appropriate because the researcher is interested in detecting any significant difference, regardless of whether it's an increase or decrease in scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing between one-tailed and two-tailed tests depends on the research question and the hypothesis being tested. One-tailed tests can be more powerful (i.e., have a higher chance of detecting a true effect) when there is a strong expectation of the direction of the effect. However, they are more conservative in the sense that they only detect significant effects in the specified direction. On the other hand, two-tailed tests are more appropriate when there is no specific expectation about the direction of the effect or when researchers want to remain open to the possibility of both positive and negative effects."

    "In hypothesis testing, Type 1 and Type 2 errors are two types of mistakes that can occur when making decisions about a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (Ha). These errors are associated with the concept of significance levels and power in statistical testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Type 1 Error (False Positive):\n",
    "A Type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis (H0) is true, but we mistakenly reject it in favor of the alternative hypothesis (Ha). In other words, it is the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis. The probability of committing a Type 1 error is denoted by the significance level (α) and is typically set before conducting the hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenario:\n",
    "Let's say a pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug's effectiveness against a placebo in treating a certain medical condition. The null hypothesis (H0) states that the drug has no effect, while the alternative hypothesis (Ha) suggests that the drug is effective. The significance level (α) is set at 0.05 (5%).\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 1 error occurs if the company concludes that the drug is effective (rejects H0) when, in reality, it is not. If, in fact, the drug has no effect, but due to random chance or other factors, the study results show a significant difference between the drug and placebo groups, the company might mistakenly claim that the drug works (committing a Type 1 error).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Type 2 Error (False Negative):\n",
    "A Type 2 error occurs when the null hypothesis (H0) is false, but we fail to reject it and incorrectly accept the alternative hypothesis (Ha). In other words, it is the failure to detect a true effect or difference when it actually exists. The probability of committing a Type 2 error is denoted by β.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenario:\n",
    "Continuing with the pharmaceutical company's example, let's say the drug actually has a significant positive effect on the medical condition. However, in the study, due to a small sample size or other factors, the test fails to detect this effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 2 error occurs when the company fails to conclude that the drug is effective (does not reject H0) when, in reality, it is. If the drug has a real positive effect, but the study fails to produce statistically significant results, the company may incorrectly conclude that the drug does not work (committing a Type 2 error).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to strike a balance between Type 1 and Type 2 errors when designing hypothesis tests. Decreasing the significance level (α) to reduce the risk of Type 1 errors will increase the risk of Type 2 errors, and vice versa. Researchers often consider the context of the study and the potential consequences of each type of error to make informed decisions about the appropriate significance level and sample size."
