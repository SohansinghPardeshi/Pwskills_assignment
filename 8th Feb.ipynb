    "ANS1 --> Abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the process of hiding implementation details and providing a simpler and more general interface for users to interact with.

    "\n",
    "An example of abstraction could be a class that represents a car. From a user's perspective, they only need to know how to drive the car, turn it on and off, and steer it. They do not need to know how the engine, transmission, or brakes work. These details are hidden from the user, and they only interact with the car through a simpler interface, such as a steering wheel, pedals, and switches.\n",

    "In this example, the car class provides an abstraction of a real car, hiding its implementation details and exposing only the essential features for users to interact with. By using abstraction, the car class can be used by many different users without requiring them to have specialized knowledge of how the car works. This makes the code more modular, easier to understand, and less prone to errors.\n",
