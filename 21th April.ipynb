    "**Q1. What is the main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in KNN? How might this difference affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor?**\n",
    "- The main difference lies in how distance is measured between two points. Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance, while Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences along each dimension. The choice may impact KNN based on the geometry of the data. In cases where features are on different scales, Euclidean distance might be sensitive to the dominant features, whereas Manhattan distance may be less affected.\n",

    "**Q2. How do you choose the optimal value of k for a KNN classifier or regressor? What techniques can be used to determine the optimal k value?**\n",
    "- Techniques include cross-validation, grid search, and plotting the model's performance against different k values. Cross-validation helps to estimate how well the model will generalize to an independent dataset, and grid search systematically tests different hyperparameter values. The optimal k is typically chosen based on the best performance metric.\n",

    "**Q3. How does the choice of distance metric affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor? In what situations might you choose one distance metric over the other?**\n",
    "- The choice of distance metric depends on the data characteristics. Euclidean distance is suitable when the underlying relationships in the data are well-represented by straight-line distances. Manhattan distance may be preferred when features have different scales or when the relationships are better represented by paths along the coordinate axes. It's often a matter of empirical testing to see which works better for a given dataset.\n",

    "**Q4. What are some common hyperparameters in KNN classifiers and regressors, and how do they affect the performance of the model? How might you go about tuning these hyperparameters to improve model performance?**\n",
    "- Common hyperparameters include k (number of neighbors), distance metric, and sometimes the choice of algorithm (e.g., brute force, KD-tree). The impact on performance depends on the dataset. Grid search and cross-validation are common techniques to find optimal hyperparameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. How does the size of the training set affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor? What techniques can be used to optimize the size of the training set?**\n",
    "- A smaller training set may result in more variability in nearest neighbors, potentially leading to overfitting. A larger training set can provide a more representative sample of the data. Techniques to optimize size include cross-validation to assess model performance across different training set sizes and collecting more data if feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. What are some potential drawbacks of using KNN as a classifier or regressor? How might you overcome these drawbacks to improve the performance of the model?**\n",
    "- Drawbacks include sensitivity to irrelevant features, computational inefficiency for large datasets, and the impact of noise. Feature selection, dimensionality reduction, using optimized data structures (KD-trees, ball trees), and applying appropriate preprocessing techniques (e.g., scaling) can help overcome these challenges. Additionally, considering ensemble methods or using distance weighting can improve KNN's performance."
