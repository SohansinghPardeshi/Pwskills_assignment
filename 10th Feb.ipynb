    "Q2.\n",
    "Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the close() function is used to close a file. It is important to close a file after you have finished working with it because it frees up system resources and ensures that any data in the file buffer is written to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a file in Python, the operating system allocates resources to the file, such as memory and input/output buffers. If you do not close the file when you are done with it, these resources will remain allocated until the program ends or the system runs out of resources. This can lead to performance issues and may cause your program to crash if you open too many files and run out of system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to freeing up system resources, closing a file ensures that any data in the file buffer is written to the file. When you write to a file, the data is often not written to the file immediately. Instead, it is first written to a buffer in memory, which is more efficient. The operating system then writes the data to the file in the background, usually in blocks. If you do not close the file, any data still in the buffer may not be written to the file, resulting in data loss or corruption."
