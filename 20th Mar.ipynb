    "**Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data encoding is the process of converting categorical or qualitative data into a numerical format that can be understood and processed by machine learning algorithms. Categorical data consists of distinct categories or labels and doesn't have a natural numerical representation. Data encoding is useful in data science because it allows machine learning algorithms to work with these categorical features, making it possible to perform tasks like classification, regression, and clustering on such data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What is nominal encoding? Provide an example of how you would use it in a real-world scenario.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding, also known as label encoding, involves assigning a unique numerical value to each category in a categorical feature. This encoding is suitable when there's no inherent order or hierarchy among the categories. An example would be encoding different countries in a \"Country\" feature using numerical labels (e.g., USA: 0, Canada: 1, Germany: 2, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. In what situations is nominal encoding preferred over one-hot encoding? Provide a practical example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding when there is no meaningful order or hierarchy among the categorical values. For instance, when encoding different car models like \"Sedan,\" \"SUV,\" and \"Hatchback,\" nominal encoding could be used. One-hot encoding would create additional columns for each category, which might not make sense in cases where there is no inherent relationship between the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Suppose you have a dataset containing categorical data with 5 unique values. Which encoding technique would you use to transform this data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms? Explain why you made this choice.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the categorical data has no inherent order or hierarchy, and you want to maintain a compact representation, you would use nominal encoding. This is because nominal encoding assigns a single numerical label to each category, which keeps the dimensionality low while representing the different categories effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. In a machine learning project, you have a dataset with 1000 rows and 5 columns. Two of the columns are categorical, and the remaining three columns are numerical. If you were to use nominal encoding to transform the categorical data, how many new columns would be created? Show your calculations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have two categorical columns and you're using nominal encoding, you would create one new numerical column for each categorical column. Therefore, you would create 2 new columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. You are working with a dataset containing information about different types of animals, including their species, habitat, and diet. Which encoding technique would you use to transform the categorical data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms? Justify your answer.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the \"species\" feature, you would likely use nominal encoding, as different species likely have no inherent order. For the \"habitat\" and \"diet\" features, if there's no meaningful order among the categories, you would again use nominal encoding. This is because nominal encoding is suitable when there's no ordinal relationship among categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. You are working on a project that involves predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. You have a dataset with 5 features, including the customer's gender, age, contract type, monthly charges, and tenure. Which encoding technique(s) would you use to transform the categorical data into numerical data? Provide a step-by-step explanation of how you would implement the encoding.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this scenario, you could use nominal encoding for the \"gender\" and \"contract type\" features, as there's no inherent order among the categories. Here's how you could implement the encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gender Encoding:** Let's assume \"Male\" is encoded as 0 and \"Female\" as 1.\n",
    "2. **Contract Type Encoding:** Let's assume \"Month-to-Month\" is encoded as 0, \"One Year\" as 1, and \"Two Year\" as 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your resulting dataset would have the \"gender\" and \"contract type\" features transformed into numerical values. The \"age,\" \"monthly charges,\" and \"tenure\" features are already numerical, so no further encoding is necessary for them."
